Overview
This is an application to give users information to cities they choose, information will include weather, yelp reviews, meetups, movies, and hiking trails.

Getting Started
In theory this application will have working API's so the user would just visit the website and be able to type in a city and have information render.

Architecture
We are using the following resources: heroku, CORS - cross origin resource sharing, express library, ajax, jquery, node.js to build the back end, Visual Studio, and chrome as a browser.
